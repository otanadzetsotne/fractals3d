# fractals3d

## Generator of 3d fractals using the chaos method.

### Usage:

#### Install requirements
```commandline
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Import fractal class
```python
from chaos_theory import FractalChaos
```

#### Create fractal
```python
fractal = FractalChaos(
    points_quantity=5,  # Number of corners of the figure
    iterations=10_000,  # the number of points generated by the chaos method
)
```

#### It is possible to ge all points of fractal first
```python
points = fractal.get()
```

#### It is also possible to all get points generator
```python
points = fractal.get_generator()
```

#### Or render fractal straightaway
```python
fractal.render()
```

#### There is one concrete class FractalPyramid inherited from FractalChaos. It predefines figure corners to generate pyramid fractal
```python
from chaos_theory import FractalPyramid
```

### Example:

```python
from chaos_theory import FractalPyramid

fractal = FractalPyramid(iterations=100_000)
fractal.render(marker={'size': 1})
```
